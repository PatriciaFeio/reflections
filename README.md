Reflections from Udacity course "How to use Git and GitHub".

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I started Udacity course "How to use Git and GitHub" with the objective of learning to use version control and the collaborative
platform GitHub to start to create a public portfolio.

I'm currently working for a career change. In 2017/2018 I made a one year Web Design course in Lisbon School of Design and in that course 
I had a programming module where I was taught the basics of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, MySQL and PHP. It was like having
a revelation, I loved it!

When the course ended I realized I didn't have a proper portfolio to present nor did I knew how to show it online, which is the best way 
to provide a portfolio to future employers.

So I started to:
<ul>
<li>consolidate what I learned in my Web Design course by taking online courses (for example, FreeCodeCamp)</li>
<li>build a portfolio with projects from my online courses</li>
<li>learn how to use Git and GitHub to start to publish my projects</li>
</ul>
