When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I would want to create a local repository in three situations (that I can remember of):

	To publish a portfolio so I can exemplify my skills, training and experiences;
	To contribute to open source projects;
	When working collaboratively on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Things automatically done are not the best option because we can lose track of 
	what is really important to pull.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of someone else's repository to our GitHub account.

	Clones are copies of a GitHub repository to our local repo.

	When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug — no matter how big or how small — you need a new line of 
	development. A new branch is then created from the main branch as a reference to a commit and all the 
	necessary commits are made within the new branch. There can be as many branches as we consider needed to develop a project. After the features are well tested or a bug fixed we can then merge the branch or branches into the main branch. 



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Allows us to compare the remote repository while working at our branch locally using git log and git diff.
	We can also merge more easily our own commits to the remote merging it locally before pushing to the remote.
