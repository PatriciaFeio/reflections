When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to create a local repository in three situations (that I can remember of):

To publish a portfolio so I can exemplify my skills, training and experiences;
To contribute to open source projects;
When working collaboratively on a project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Things automatically done are not the best option because we can lose track of 
what is really important to pull.
